    "A common practice in scraping is the download, storage, and further processing of media content (non-web pages or data files). This media can include images, audio, and video.  To store the content locally (or in a service like S3) and do it correctly, we need to know what the type of media is, and it's not enough to trust the file extension in the URL.  We will learn how to download and correctly represent the media type based on information from the web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common task is the generation of thumbnails of images, videos, or even a page of a website.  We will examine several techniques of how to generate thumbnails and make website page screenshots.  Many times these are used on a new website as thumbnail links to the scraped media that is now stored locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is often the need to be able to transcode media, such as converting non-MP4 videos to MP4, or changing the bit-rate or resolution of a video.  Another scenario is to extract only the audio from a video file.  We won't look at video transcoding, but we will rip MP3 audio out of an MP4 file using ffmpeg.  It's a simple step from there to also transcode video with ffmpeg."
